# nodejs-static-file-server
A node.js server to serve static files without using a framework.

I took code from an MDN article and I modified it slightly to serve static files that are saved in my public directory.

Here is the link to that article https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Node_server_without_framework

You can saved your files and link all your css, js, images, and photos like you normally would when making a static website. Just make sure you safe them inside the public directory.

You can delete all files and folders in the public directory and add your website files to the public directory.

# port
Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
